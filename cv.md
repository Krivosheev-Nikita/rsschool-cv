## **About Myself**
 I am 24 years old, I live in Saratov Mountain. I started my career as a process engineer at Torex, where I still work.
    Over time, I decided to change my profession. My eyes fell on the IT sphere, I decided to start by studying the profession of a Front-end Developer.
       I believe that thanks to the courses from RS School, I will achieve my purpose.
